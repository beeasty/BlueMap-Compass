# READ ME
This fork was made for my Local Paper Server (1.21.8). I'm not familiar with Java, Folia or Paper. <sup>or anything really</sup>  
I only striped its folia content and replaced it with "standard" Bukkit.  
This just works (at least in my localserver...), sooo feel free to improve it, because I have no idea what I'm doing :)

# BlueMap Compass Plugin

A Minecraft plugin that allows players to view and set waypoint to BlueMap markers through a custom GUI when right-clicking with a compass.

1. **Get a Compass**: Obtain any compass item (vanilla compass works)
2. **Right-Click**: Right-click with the compass in hand
3. **Browse Markers**: The GUI will show all available BlueMap markers
4. **Teleport**: Click on any marker to set waypoint tracker

## Banner Markers (Built-in Feature)

- Players can create **Banner Markers** by placing banners with custom name in the world.
- Banner markers are automatically detected and shown in the GUI and on BlueMap.
- Each banner marker displays its color, name, location, and owner.
- Players can track/untrack banner markers as waypoints just like any other marker.
- Banner markers are persistent and integrated with the plugin's waypoint and display system.
